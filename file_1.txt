#  File Paths

#  To get Python to open file from a dir other
#     than the one where the program file is 
#     stored, we need a file path
#  As text_files is inside python_work, we can
#     use a relative file path to open a file from
#     text_files
#  A relative file path tells Python to look for the
#     given location relative to the dir, where the
#     currently running program file is stored.
#
#  Write in OS X
#     with open('text_files/filename.txt') as file_object:
#
#  We use an absolute path if a relative path doesn't work
#  With absolute paths we can read files from any location 
#     in the system
#
#  Write in OS X
#      file_path ='/home/ehmatthes/other_files/text_files/filename.txt'
#      with open(file_path) as file_object:
