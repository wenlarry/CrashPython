#  Styling Classes

#  Class Names should be in CamelCaps

#  Every class should have a doctring following the class
#     definition. It should be a brief description of what
#     the class does

#  Each module should have a docstring describing what the
#    classes in the module can be used for

#  Within a class, we can use one blank line btw methods and
#     within a module, we can use two blank lines to separate
#     classes

#  If we need to import a module from the std lib and a module
#     that we write, place the import stat for the std lib 
#     module first. Then add a blank line and the import stat
#     for  the module that you write
